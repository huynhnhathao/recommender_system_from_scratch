## Implementation of some Recommender Algorithms
My implementation of some of the Recommender system algorithms from scratch, with the only purpose is to read the code and understand the algorithm. I do not explain the algorithm, but I will point to the specific chapter describe the algorithm in *Recommender Systems: The Textbook by Charu C. Aggarwal*.

For now, only the User-based/Item-based Collaborative filtering are available. These algorithm are described in chapter 2.3, page 33 in the aforementioned book.

Memory-based Collaborative filtering in rsfromscratch/CollaborativeFiltering/CollaborativeFiltering.py

Example usage in notebooks


I am a human, I made mistakes, so don't consider my code as ground true, feel free to change it if you need to.

**code will appear in 2021/10/19**

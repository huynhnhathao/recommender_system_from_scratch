## Implementation of some Recommender Algorithms

* My implementation of some of the Recommender system algorithms from scratch, with the only purpose is to read the code and understand the algorithm. I do not explain the algorithm, but I will point to the specific chapter describe the algorithm in *Recommender Systems: The Textbook by Charu C. Aggarwal*.


* Example usage in notebooks

* Available Implementations:
  - User-based/Item-based Collaborative filtering: chapter 2.3, page 33.
  - Content-based algorithm.
